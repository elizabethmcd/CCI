# This markdown file contains the workflow and list of things I have installed on the VM. 

## 2017-07-11

Made the initial git repository commit with the instructions for setting up a VM through CCI and my initial shell script with the commands for configuring sudo privileges, fileshare mount, and software/packages installation. The following software/packages are included in the shell script and are successfully installed: 

- BBMap
- Samtools
- Python pandas
- Python pip for installation of packages 
- HMMer
- MCL

Somehow I got BLAST to install. Not sure how.
